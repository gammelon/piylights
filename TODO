jit validation of inputs (partially done)
authentication for webinterface
buttons for "fade to color"
restructure { move fx to separate file, rename files according to code ^^)
preset api more crudlike
unify all fx to fit chain!

maybe group parameters

support chains
properties:
chains loop over arrays of modes with settings
e.g. strobe yellow for 100 ticks, then fade to blue, loop
loop y/n
tick multiplier(slower/faster)


finally --> edit chains in webinterface




small things:
keep dropdown open after click
beautiful list in dropdown
fix presetbar
only delim when not first
add preset 'tag' to input grp
