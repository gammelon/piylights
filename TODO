jit validation of inputs (partially done)
authentication for webinterface
buttons for "fade to color"
restructure { move fx to separate file, rename files according to code ^^)
preset api more crudlike
unify all fx to fit chain!

activate/deactivate bug
sometimes outputting "failed" over and over, why?

maybe group parameters
merge operationChain(...) with update(...) after everything is converted

maybe add a "displayname" for the params and so on... low priority
reduce load when saving params by checking $pristine
almost everything is unchecked in this code, if some value does not fit the expected model everything fails
--> introduce some error checking

make sure all values are initialized
support chains
properties:
chains loop over arrays of modes with settings
e.g. strobe yellow for 100 ticks, then fade to blue, loop
loop y/n
tick multiplier(slower/faster)

finally --> edit chains in webinterface




small things:
keep dropdown open after click
fix btn group (rectangular buttons in the middle)
beautiful list in dropdown
fix presetbar
only delim when not first
add preset 'tag' to input grp
